# QA_Seismic_Staggerd_StaggerGrid_FD

This repository contains supplementary materials and code related to the research paper titled "Seismic Wave Propagation Simulation with Quantum Computing." In this study, we introduce an innovative iterative quantum annealing algorithm designed to tackle ill-conditioned problems in geophysics. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in stability and accuracy when applied to staggered-grid finite-difference operators.
